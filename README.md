## Managing AWS Infrastructure with Terraform 

* Each directory contains all of the terraform scripts necessary to launch each service as well as a `README.md` file with more information 
* Each folder will have a `deploy.sh`, `delete.sh` , and `update.sh` file.
* You can check the current state of each service with the command `terraform show` inside each folder
